           <h2> The size of the cube symbolizes your perception of self: <br>
            If the cube is very large in relation to the desert, it means that you are strongly self-centered, and your perception of yourself depends largely on your evaluation and feelings about yourself.
            On the contrary, it means you are sensitive to the little things and flowers around you, and your perception of yourself is largely based on how you are perceived by others around you.<br>
            <br>
            The distance between you and the cube symbolizes your degree of self-awareness: <br>
            If the cube is far away, it means that you have never been sure or certain of yourself, and that constant self-exploration is the only thing you can be sure of and enjoy.
            If the cube is close, it means that you know yourself very well, are always confident, face your shortcomings and work hard to improve yourself.<br>
            <br>
            The material of the cube symbolizes your level of defensive psychology: <br>
            If you feel that the cube is made of hard and impenetrable material like steel, it means that you are used to building a strong wall for your inner self, you seem impenetrable and invulnerable to all kinds of poison, but in fact, this is your psychological defense and sense of security.
            If it is a solid but workable material, such as leather or wood, it shows that you are both strong and full of warmth, and that your warmth goes beyond your heart and is infectious to those around you.<br>
            <br>
            The transparency of the cube symbolizes your attitude towards your inner emotions:<br>
            If the cube is transparent, it means that you are willing and enjoy communicating your emotions to others, that you are truthful and honest with your friends, and that you trust others easily.
            If it is opaque it means you don't like to share your inner emotions with others, you will be very concerned about your privacy and have a certain sense of mystery.
